1. Create a string made of the first, middle and last character

For example:

str1 = "James"
Output: "Jms"


2. Write a program to create a new string made of the middle three characters of an input string.

For example:

Example 1:
  str1 = "JhonDipPeta"
  
  Expected output: "Dip"
  
Example 2:
  str1 = "JaSonAy"
  
  Expected output: "Son"
  
3. Given two strings, s1 and s2. Write a program to create a new string s3 by appending s2 in the middle of s1.

Example:
  s1 = "Ault"
  s2 = "Kelly"
  
  Expected output : "AuKellylt"
  
  
4. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write a program to return a new string made of s1 and s2â€™s first, middle, and last characters.

Example:
  s1 = "America"
  s2 = "Japan"
  
  Expected output: "AJrpan"
  
5. Write a program that convert a alphabet letter to binary string using ASCII table (http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html)

Example 1:
  letter = "A"
  
  Expected output: "01000001"
  
Example 2:
  letter = "a"
  
  Expected output: "01100001"
